Competitive Programming


Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several multinational software and Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook.

A programming competition generally involves the host presenting a set of logical or mathematical problems, also known as puzzles, to the contestants (who can vary in number from tens to several thousands), and contestants are required to write computer programs capable of solving each problem. Judging is based mostly upon number of problems solved and time spent for writing successful solutions, but may also include other factors (quality of output produced, execution time, memory usage, program size, etc.)

Notable competitions
There are two types of competition formats: short-term and long-term. Each round of short-term competition lasts from 1 to 5 hours. Long-term competitions can last from a few days to a few months.

Short-term
International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) – one of the oldest competitions, for students of universities in groups of 3 persons each
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) – one of the oldest competitions, for secondary school students
American Computer Science League (ACSL) – computer science competition with written and programming portions, for middle/high school students
CodeChef – competition held from 2009, there are three contests held every month[6] and an annual competition called CodeChef SnackDown[7]
Codeforces Round – typically two hour contest, held every week[8]
Facebook Hacker Cup – competition held from 2011, provided and sponsored by Facebook
HackerRank – multiple competitions[9]
Gridwars – four competitions held between 2003 and 2004.
Google Code Jam – competition held from 2003, provided and sponsored by Google
IEEEXtreme Programming Competition[10] – annual competition for IEEE Student Members held since 2006 by IEEE.
Topcoder Open (TCO) – Algorithm competition held since 2001 by Topcoder
In most of the above competitions, since the number of contestants is quite large, competitions are usually organized in several rounds. They usually require online participation in all rounds except the last, which requires onsite participation. A special exception to this is IEEEXtreme, which is a yearly 24-hour virtual programming competition. The top performers at IOI and ICPC receive gold, silver and bronze medals while in the other contests, cash prizes are awarded to the top finishers. Also hitting the top places in the score tables of such competitions may attract interest of recruiters from software and Internet companies.
